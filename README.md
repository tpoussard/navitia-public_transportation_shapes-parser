## A python3 script to parse France public transportation open data csv file and output geojson file

I needed this script in order to create tiles in Mapbox, but they can be used with any map system using Geojson.

Open datas are to download from https://www.navitia.io/datasets inside 'table' and placed inside a file named "ntfs"

This is a work in progress, some differences can be found between idf files and the rest of France then betwen France areas, for now idf is working and south-west quarter is comming soon.
