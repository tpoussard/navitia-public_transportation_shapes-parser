# navitia_public-transportation-line-shapes_parser
A python3 script to parse France public transportation open data csv file and output geojson file

I used it in order to create tiles in Mapbox, but can be used with any map system using Geojson.

Open datas are to download from https://www.navitia.io/datasets inside 'table'

The files are already dowloaded but should be renew when Navita release datas update at least twice a year.
